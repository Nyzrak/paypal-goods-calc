### Feel free to contribute to this project and help me make it even better. I will provide a domain and a Webserver where this project will be hosted.

## Setup
To set the project up you have to run it into a virtual environment (venv)
cd into the project root, then run:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```
Then activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
To verify the virtual environment works, run:
```bash
which python
```
#### If you want to deactivate the virtual environment run:
```bash
deactivate
```
This should output the project root as python source e.g.:
```bash
/path/to/project/paypal-goods-calc/.venv/bin/python
```
To start the development server, run:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### If you find any errors or have ideas you can always let me know by either forking the repo, creating an issue or even text me on discord.
I'll appreciate it :)

Thank you for reading this
